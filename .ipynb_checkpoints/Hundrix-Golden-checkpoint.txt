Golden by HuntriX

I was a ghost, I was alone
Given the throne, I didn't
know how to believe

I was the queen that
I'm meant to be (oh)

I lived two lives, tried
to play both sides

But I couldn't find my
own place (oh, oh)

Called a problem child,
'cause I got too wild

But now that's how I'm 
gettin' paid, on stage

I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
We dreamin'hard, we came so far
Now I believe
We're going' up,up,`''
