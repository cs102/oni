**Note:** The doubling typically occurs when:
1. Adding suffixes to words ending in a single consonant after a short vowel (run → running)
2. In compound words or root combinations
3. In words borrowed from other languages that maintain their spelling

This progression helps students understand spelling patterns and phonetic rules as they advance through their education.
